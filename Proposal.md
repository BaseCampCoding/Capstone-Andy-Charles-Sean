## Shelf Wear

### Description and Motivation
We wanted to create a platform where the user has easy access for cloths shopping. The first page will be the homepage and will have the sign up and login button in the navbar. When the user is logged in, the navbar will have categories to clothes like tops, pants and shoes. Contents will be in the body with a short description and when clicked, user will be redirected into a detail page of the product. The detail page will a description and reviews of the product. User can then add item into a cart and will only be able to check out if the user is signed in. We wanted to give the user a experience like buying cloths online from Amazon, Old Navy, Zumiez and American Eagle.
