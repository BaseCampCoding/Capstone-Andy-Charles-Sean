## Shelf Wear

### Description and Motivation
We want create a platform where the user has easy access for clothes shopping. We also want to give the the user a good experience like buying clothes online from Amazon, Old Navy, Zumiez and American Eagle. Our motivation is to make online shopping as easy as possible just by browsing for what you need through filter and adding coupons to your transactions so no one has to pay as much for the things you like.

### Prior Art
Prior arts to this project would be websites such as, Amazon, American Eagle, H&M, and etc. The design will be made based on what we feel like is the best design for UI/UX.

### Core User Workflows
- Navbar: The User is able to browse through the clothes on the website by using the navbar that has different categories of clothes such as tops, pants, and shoes.
- Detail Page: If a item is click, the user will then see that item detail page.
- Checkout: Once, the user tries to make a purchase, the user will need to make an account or log into an existing account to continue with the transaction. Then the user basic information will be needed for shipping such as name, email, address, and credit card information.
- Cart: All item that are selected will be added to the cart and then viewed later by the user.
- Email Transaciton Information - When the order is completed by the user, then the program will send the user an email with a summary of what they have purchased.
